            <h1> Bacon </h1>

                It is naturally smoked and contains no added nitrites or nitrates. The meat is salted and then naturally smoked. During smoking, all of the liquid from our brining process is evaporated, resulting in meaty, tender bacon that shrinks less when cooked. Add it to a grilled cheese sandwich, wrap it around a filet mignon, crumble it into cheese cookie buns or, to wow your dinner guests, infuse it with bourbon for an aperitif.

            The prime rib roast is the creme de la creme of roasts

                Recognized for being tender and juicy, accompany it with bran au jus for even more flavor. We suggest baking at 325°F or if you have more time, at 275°F. The roast will be very juicy, provided it does not exceed the internal temperature of 71°C (160°F), which is equivalent to a “medium” degree of doneness. (Internal temperature for a medium-rare: 63°C or 145°F.) To make your roast even better, let it rest for about twenty minutes in aluminum foil after cooking. This last step will make all the difference.
